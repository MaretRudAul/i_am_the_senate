# Now YOU can become the Senate

## Features:
- A new federation law that merges all other nations in the federation with the president's nation. This law requires very high centralization.
- Things that are transferred include systems, fleets/ships, leaders, resources, and relics.
- Shriek sound when the takeover occurs.
- You can choose to vassalize the other empires instead of unifying them! If you are a megacorp they will become subsidiaries, and if you are not a megacorp they will become protectorates (with the ability to become vassals).
- AI knows how to use this mod.
- A rebel empire called **The Resistance** forms and goes to war with you to resist your takeover!

You can now unite your federation for a safe, and secure, society!

---

## To be added eventually:
- A storyline where you can fight back against the takeover of the senate, fighting for freedom. Or even possibly try to take over the federation yourself, despite not being president.
- Copying known tech.
- A resolution in the galactic community that unites the galactic community into one empire (there will be an option to turn this off). This option is also going to be more violent as empires that really hate yours will not comply.

## Compatibility:
Should be compatible with everything.
